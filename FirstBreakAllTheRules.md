# Random Quotes and my points

* A good manager shoul help secure the fives in Base Camp and Camp1

* The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still maintain the ability to function

* To secure `strongly agree` responses to the item `at work, i have the opportunity to do what I do best every day` you must know how to selet a person. This sounds straightforward, but to do it well demands clearheadedness. Most important, you must know how much of a person you can change. You must know the difference between talent, skills and knowledge. You must know which of these can be taught and which can only be hirded in. You must know how to ask the kinds of questions that can cut through a candidate's desire to imporess and so reveal his true talents. 

* Managers and leaders are two different roles. One can be a great manager and very bad leader and a leader can be a great leader and a very bad manager. Managers are inward looking, their main focus is to release an individual's talent into performance. Leaders are outward looking, looking at connections and cracks, focusing on broad patterns, visionaries and strategic thinkers. 

* Unfortunate Victim of good intentions

* Four core activities on which managers should focus
    * select a person -- select for talent, not simply experience or intelligence or determination
    * set expectation --  define the right outcomes, not the right steps
    * motivate the person -- focus on strengths not on weakness
    * develop the person -- help find the right fit not simply next position in the heirarchy 

* Revolutionary insight common to all great managers
    * People don't change that much
    * Don't waste time trying to put in what was left out
    * Try to draw out what was left in
    * That is hard enough
